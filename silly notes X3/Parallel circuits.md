There is more than one path for the current to flow
# pros and cons of series [[silly notes X3/Circuits]]
## pros
bulbs are brighter than those in a [[silly notes X3/Series circuits|series]] [[silly notes X3/Circuits|circuit]].

## cons
parallel [[silly notes X3/Circuits]] work even if there is a break in the circuit in one of the paths
parallel [[silly notes X3/Circuits]] use more [[silly notes X3/Energy|energy]].
