current is the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">rate of flow of charges</mark>
the SI unit is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">amperes (A)</mark>
an ammeter is used to measure the current in a circuit at a certain point


> [!Tip] 
> The current in a series circuit is the same throughout

# current over different circuits
## current across a [[silly notes X3/Series circuits|series circuit]]:
The current passing through the circuit is the same throughout
$$
I_{e} = I_{1} = I_{2} = ...
$$

## current across a [[silly notes X3/Parallel circuits|parallel circuit]]:
$$
I_{e} = I_{1} + I _{2} + ...
$$
