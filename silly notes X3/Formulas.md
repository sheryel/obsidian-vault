## current
$$ I = \frac{Q}{t} $$
Q = [Charge](Charge.md) in coulomb (C)  
t = [Time](Time.md) in seconds (s)
## work done
$$ W = Q \cdot V $$
Q = [Charge](Charge.md) in coulomb (C)  
## potential difference
$$ V = \frac{W}{Q} = \frac{E}{Q} $$
W = [work done](Formulas.md#work%20done)  
E = [Energy](Energy.md) converted
V = [potential difference](potential%20difference%20and%20electromotive%20force)
## energy
$$ E = \frac{W}{Q} $$
$$ E = VI \cdot t = P \cdot t $$
P = [power](Formulas.md#power) in watts (W)  
E = [energy](Energy.md) in joules
## resistance
$$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$
$$ R = \frac{ρL}{A} $$  
R = resistance
ρ = resistivity
L = length
A = area of cross section
## power
$$ P = VI $$
$$ P = I^2 \cdot R = \frac{V^2}{R} $$
## cost
$$ \text{Cost} = E \cdot \text{unit cost} $$
