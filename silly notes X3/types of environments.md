categorized into three different types:
- [natural](natural)
- [managed](managed)
- [constructed](constructed)

We categorize them based on criteria
such as their:  
-  physical characteristics (Hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere)  
	+ landforms (e.g. mountains, volcanoes), waterbodies, coast, vegetation  
- Human activities - amount of human modification such as human settlements, agriculture  

> [!NOTE] Why categorize?
> Categories help us understand these interactions between natural and human elements, analyze the spatial patterns and how they are distributed on Earth.
