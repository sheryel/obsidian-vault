# pros and cons of series [[silly notes X3/Circuits]]
## pros
series [[silly notes X3/Circuits]] use less [[silly notes X3/Energy|energy]]

## cons
series [[silly notes X3/Circuits]] dont work once there is a fused bulb (or break in the circuit)
bulbs are less bright than those in a [[silly notes X3/Parallel circuits|parallel circuit]].
