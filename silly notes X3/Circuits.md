# circuits
a circuit can exist in one of two states: [[silly notes X3/Circuits#open circuits|open]] or closed
# components
a circuit has 4 main components:
- a [[silly notes X3/potential difference and electromotive force#EMF|battery]]
- a load (bulb, motor etc)
- conductors (wires)
- switches
# open circuits
occurs when theres a break in the circuit
current cannot flow through the circuit
can occur due to open switches, missing connections, loose wires or a broken component
# short circuits
short circuits occur when there is a loop from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the cell without any load (a part of the circuit connection is bypassed)

> the current takes the path of least resistance so it will flow through from the positive terminal to the negative terminal
> using $I = \frac{V}{R}$, when there is no resistance the current will be infinite, leading to overheating and danger of fire
