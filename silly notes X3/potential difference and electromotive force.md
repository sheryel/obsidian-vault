# PD
is the **work done per unit charge** to drive charges through the component **between two points**  
is measured in **volts**  

> [!NOTE]
> 9.0 volts of potential difference means that 9 joules of energy is required to move one coulomb of charge across the component

# EMF
**work done per unit charge by the source** around a complete circuit
measured in volts
the emf source is usually a **cell**
the source transfers energy in the chemical potential store into other store(s) electrically
the charge gains energy from the cell
