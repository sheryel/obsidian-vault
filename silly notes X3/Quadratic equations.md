# function $f(x)$  

> [!big-idea] 
> **Functions**

In graphs, all equations have one input ($x$) and one output ($y$).  
This relationship is called a **function**

> [!big-idea] 
> **notations**

We use the notation  $y = f(x)$ to mean that y is a function of x.  
For example, we may write a quadratic function as $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c$ instead of $y = ax^2+bx+c$
