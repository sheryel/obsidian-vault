# What is RAM?
ram stands for Random Access Memory
RAM temporarily stores data for the CPU to access quickly
RAM can be almost 100,000 times faster than [[|persistent storage]]

>[!NOTE]
> When a computer is rebooted, the OS and other important files are loaded onto the ram from [[silly notes X3/Secondary storage|secondary storage]]
# RAM is volatile[^volatility]
this means that ram cannot be used to store files permanently



[^volatility]: volatile means that data is lost once power to the component is cut off
