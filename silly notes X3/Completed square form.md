With the function $f(x) = x^2 - 4$, we can easily see that $f(x) \geq 4$ as $x^2 \geq 0$. The completed square form aims to do the same.   

$$f(x) = (x-h)^2 + k$$

The completed square form aims to let us find all real values of the function easily.   
There is an easy way to convert from $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$:  
1. divide $x^2$ and $x$ by $a$
2. replace the $x$ and $h$ in $(x-h)^2$ with $x$ and half of $b$ respectively
3. replace $k$ with $\frac{b}{2}-c$

> $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$   
>$= a(x - \frac{b}{a+2}) + (\frac{b}{a+2}-c)$
